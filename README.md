# rock-paper_scissor-Game
I started studying web development a few months ago and to practice my skills I decided to do the game of rock, paper, scissors. This is a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can play against the computer. The computer makes decisions using a random function. The game keeps track of scores.
